# SortingVisualizer

Simple sorting visualizer that animates bubble-sort, insertion-sort, merge-sort, quick-sort, and heap-sort.

## Description

SortingVisualizer is a web app developed in React to animate and visualize different sorting algorithms. The features include a way to speed up the animations, generate a new randomized set of numbers, audio cues to showcase which element is curerntly selected, and changing the size of the underlying array. Be warned that larger sizes will cause the animation to work slower with some of the algorithms that grow in polynomial time. The current app is hosted on github pages, the link can be found [here](http://cameronMcConnell.github.io/SortingVisualizer). Hope you enjoy!
