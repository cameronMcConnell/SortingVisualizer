Please visit http://cameronMcConnell.github.io/React-Projects to view the Sorting-Visualizer.

This project uses only React for the front-end. The bars are actually just divs where their heights are randomized whenever a new array is generated. When any of the buttons are pressed, you will be locked out from performing any actions until the animation has finished playing. I would recommend that you not choose a large array size and perform and O(n^2) algorithm like bubble-sort or insertion-sort as it will take forever to finish said animations (but not as much as bogo-sort). The general process of animating the algorithms is very simple. First, the algorithm that corresponds to a said button sorts the div elements by height. While the sorting is taking place, an animations list is being built which takes lists as elements. These list elements are either comparisons or swaps. An animation function for each algorithm is called after said algorithm is completed where timeout functions space out the different animations. The function is basically iterating over the animations list and just executing said animation based on the current element. This was harder to implement for some algorithms that have recurrsion like quick-sort, merge-sort, or heap-sort but in the end it all worked out. Please enjoy.
